# JS Experiments

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects I built to practice and experiment with different features of the language.

## Projects included

- **Wordle**  
  A recreation of the classic Wordle game using JavaScript. The player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word. The app fetches a random word from an external API. After each guess, the app shows which letters are correct, close, or wrong.  
  **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- **Calculator**  
  A basic calculator app that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes a clear (C) button to reset the input and a delete (DEL) button to remove the last digit.  
  **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- **Doggo Fetcher**  
  An app that fetches and displays random dog images using the Dog CEO API. The project includes implementations with both promises and async/await.  
  **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dog API

- **Animation**  
  A simple animation using the Popmotion library. A ball element moves back and forth horizontally in an infinite loop.  
  **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Popmotion
